# VC Solar App

Conventional solar cadastres usually calculate the solar radiation for roofs in 2.5D on the basis of a surface model.
The potential of facade surfaces and the analysis of planned buildings are not mapped by conventional cadastres.

With VC Solar, we present you with a comprehensive solution for determining and analyzing solar radiation and
photovoltaic output for all building and open spaces in 3D. With VC Solar, you can calculate the solar suitability
interactively in the browser for any area in 3D, regardless of whether you use a CityGML-based building model,
a 3D mesh model or a planning scenario as the basis. Shading and planning objects are taken into account, and you
can adapt the calculation of yield, CO2 savings, and profitability to your individual situation.

VC Solar consists of two components, which are also offered as a VC Solar Bundle. The first is the VC Solar Backend
for area-wide 3D solar potential analyses and is not part of this Open Source project. The second is the VC Solar App
for interactive solar potential analyses directly in the VC Map.

The interactive VC Solar App contains a yield calculator that determines the photovoltaic output on the basis of
semantic areas and drawn open spaces and allows the dimensioning and evaluation of a specific solar installation.
The app can be used directly in the web-based map application VC Map. In addition to the building models, the app
can also be used with 3D mesh models as well as planning models and planning scenarios from the VC Planner. Users
can enter household parameters such as energy consumption, own use and costs to customize the calculations. The app
also provides an analysis of the CO2 savings potential and cost-effectiveness, taking degradation into account for
a long-term cost-benefit analysis.
