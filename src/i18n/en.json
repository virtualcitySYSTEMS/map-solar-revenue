        "infoContent": "The interactive VC Solar App contains a yield calculator that determines the photovoltaic output based on semantic areas and drawn open spaces and allows the dimensioning and evaluation of a specific solar installation. In addition to roof surfaces and facades, the software can also take into account shading from other objects such as trees, dormers or planned buildings. All objects and models loaded into the VC Map contribute to shading calculations allowing interactive solar yield calculations directly in the browser. Individual adjustments enable efficient and environmentally friendly planning of the solar system. Cities, municipalities and citizens benefit from intuitive reporting and integration into existing planning processes. \n\nVirtual City Systems was founded in 2005 and has established itself as a pioneer in the field of urban digital twins based on 3D city models. With headquarters in Berlin and a branch in Grafing, the software company is part of the international CADFEM Group. More than 200 customers, including cities such as Hamburg, Rotterdam, Vienna and Singapore, use the innovative solutions for the management, visualization and use of 3D geodata. Virtual City Systems relies on open standards and open source software to support cities and municipalities in using digital tools to design urban environments and develop sustainable solutions.\n\nAre you a local authority or municipal service provider interested in a digital solution for solar potential analysis?
